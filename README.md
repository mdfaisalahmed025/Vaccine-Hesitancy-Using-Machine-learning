# Vaccine-Hesitancy-Using-Machine-learning

COVID-19 pandemic caused lots of losses, both
human and economic. To bring the amount of COVID cases
down vaccination of populations is crutial. One of the problems
when it comes to vaccinating people, is that many are hesitant to
get vaccinated for various reasons. So if we could predict those
who might be hesitant to get vaccinated, then there could be
an effort made to help reduce hesitancy. Our paper aims to do
just that. We created a predictive model that takes advantage
of data from previous work where they collected data from
volunteers regarding how they percieve their health care system
and vaccination in general. By using a machine learning model
to predict whether a user is hesitant to get vaccinated or not, we
can identify the ones that may be hesitant automatically.
